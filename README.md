# Arca Finance

## Overview
Arca Finance is a full-suite DeFi platform for stablecoins that comes with an AMM protocol specialized in efficient stable assets swapping at ultra-low fees/slippage that also enables users to earn passive income with stable assets by yield farming, lending, and vault system.

Arca functionality focuses on providing depositors the highest yields with minimal risk (little to no IL) through a combination of LP rewards and the Vaults system while offering users a near zero slippage exchange.

The Arca Finance platform is planned to support the following stablecoins: BUSD, USDT, DAI, and USDC on BSC and other chains (Nervos? details to be announced)

## Development Progress
The current development for essential features of the Arca AMM protocol (stablecoins swap, liquidity, yield farming, multi-chain support), as pushed on this repository, is ready to be tested and our early version demo has been deployed on BSC Testnet. The upcoming features including vaults, lending, governance, and bridge for multi-chain will be included in the Arca roadmap.
